# 🧩 Foundation Projects 🎮

Welcome to **Foundation**! 🚀 This is the home for my **personal Python projects**—the building blocks of a future data science wizard! 🌟 In here, you'll find beginner to intermediate-level projects that I’ve worked on, including:

- 🧠 **Tic Tac Toe** (we’re starting simple but strong)
- 💡 More to come as I tackle more fun challenges!

This repo is my digital toolbox. It’s where I store my projects, learn new tricks, and build cool stuff that powers my growth as a programmer. 💻✨

## 🕹️ Featured Projects:
### 🎲 Tic Tac Toe Game
A classic! This one features Python code magic to randomly choose the first player, alternate turns, and display a snazzy board after every move! Check it out and start playing!

> _These projects are a warm-up. I have big plans ahead!_

## 🚀 How to Get Started:
To get the projects running on your own machine, follow these easy steps:

### Step 1: Clone This Repo
Grab a copy of this repo to your machine:
```bash

Step 3: Run the Code

Pick any of the projects and run them. For example, let’s play some Tic Tac Toe! ⚔️
